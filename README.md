# CPV301
My School Projects/Workshops of Subject CPV301
Introduction
This README file provides an overview of my school projects and workshops for subject CPV301. This subject covers the fundamentals of computer vision and image processing, and I have completed a number of projects and workshops to deepen my understanding of these concepts.

Projects
Project 1: Image segmentation using clustering algorithms
In this project, I used clustering algorithms such as K-means and hierarchical clustering to segment images into distinct regions based on their pixel values. I also explored techniques for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction to improve the accuracy of my segmentation results.

Project 2: Object detection using deep learning
For this project, I trained a deep learning model using the YOLOv3 architecture to detect objects in images. I also used transfer learning to fine-tune the model on a new dataset and improve its accuracy.

Workshops
Workshop 1: Introduction to OpenCV
In this workshop, we learned the basics of OpenCV, a popular open-source computer vision library, and how to use it for tasks such as image loading, filtering, and feature detection.

Workshop 2: Image processing using Python
In this workshop, we explored various image processing techniques using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib. We covered topics such as histogram equalization, edge detection, and image restoration.

Conclusion
These projects and workshops have helped me gain a deeper understanding of the concepts and techniques covered in CPV301, as well as develop my skills in programming and data analysis. I look forward to continuing to explore this fascinating field in my future studies and projects.
